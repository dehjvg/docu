# General Info

Everyone playing on the Global Cargo servers starts as a Contractor. 
You can choose to remain a Contractor, progress to Co-op Farming, or becoming a Farm Manager.
Contractors can assist farmers by taking on contracts or handling exports. 
However, Contractors are not allowed to perform tasks on farms unless there is an active contract or export available for it.

Becoming a Co-op Farmer
A Co-owner is someone who gains rights to a farm and is allowed to invest money into it. 
The distribution of profits must be arranged between the Co-owner and the farm owner. 
However, a Co-owner does not receive the 800,000 to start a farm and cannot start their own farm while they remain a Co-owner. 
If they later decide to start their own farm, they will receive the 800,000 if it’s their first time. 
Both the Co-owner and Owner can pay each other for work done, but the Owner remains responsible for the overall management and operations of the farm.

Becoming Farm Manager
As mentioned above, you can grow your own farm by making money through helping other farmers. 
When you reach 150,000 in earnings, you can request to own your own farm.
You will keep the money you earned, and you’ll also receive an extra 800,000 to start with.

Currently, we have 3 servers, and each server can host 1 HR farm and 6 regular farms. 
When all 3 servers have more than 4 farms on them, you can choose to sponsor a new server or join one of the existing servers that still have available space. 
More information about servers can be found under the "Servers" section.
Instructions on how to complete a contract or export can be found in other documents.
