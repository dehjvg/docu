# Welcome to Global Cargo Farming! 

At Global Cargo, we’re proud to host a dynamic farming system for our Virtual Trucking Company (VTC) members. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to grow your own farming empire, our system is designed to support and reward your efforts.

Start as a Contractor
Every new member begins their journey as a contractor. Your goal? Earn 150,000 through contracts to unlock the ability to establish your very own farm. However, you’re free to remain a contractor even after reaching this milestone if you prefer the contract lifestyle.

Build Your Farm or Collaborate
Once you’ve earned enough, you can choose to build your own farm or continue supporting others as a contractor. Teamwork is encouraged, so you can also join forces with other farmers to achieve greater success together.

Special Farming Section on TrucksWeb
We’ve created a dedicated farming section on TrucksWeb to make managing your farming journey simple and transparent. Here, you can:

Track your earnings.
View the amount of work completed.
Monitor the contracts you’ve posted.
For farmers, you’ll even have the ability to sell your crops directly through the platform.
This page is here to guide you through the features and functions of our farming system so that you know exactly what you’re signing up for.
