# Sponsor a server

this page is still work in progress.


You can sponsor a new server when all other servers have 3 farms + Global Cargo HR ore more.

- When you sponsor a server you can decide on which map that server will run (if approved by us)


when you want to sponsor a server you can contact hjvg.
the first month you have to pay €40,- and after that each month €20,- this is so we know for sure we can keep the server up for 2 months. so when you stop donating we can keep it 1 month up and try to find a other sponsor for it.

Global Cargo is not making any money on it all money goes to the server payment.
