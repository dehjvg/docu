# Farmer General

When you made 100.000 as a contractor you can become a Farmer. You can request it by asking it in the farming channel or send hjvg a pm.
Before you send a message to become a farmer see on which server you want to be or if you want to sponsor a new server (more about this in the server section)


## How does it work

If you earned 100.000 as a contractor you have showen to us your here for the long term and not just for a day as setting up farms and servers is costing us time as well. Ofcourse now you want to start right away we understand that but it can still take a day or 2 as you and the admin setting you up needs to be online at the same time.

So You did look on other servers if there was still room farming 25 offers 6 farm slots +1 for Global Cargo HR Farm. And we have time to set you up you will get the farm name you selected when applying in game. As we are happy you made it till 100.000 or more and its your first time starting a farm you will recive 800.000 from us to start. When we set you up you will get the full right for your farm (dont leave your farm anymore as that will let your rights disappear) with the money you have you can do what you want buy fields and equipment. Your responsible for your farm so you decide how to run your farm with in the rules of course.


## Other farmers

As stated above your free to buy fields that you want but we want to give you a tip play to gather so when buying a field next to a other farmer talk with him first if he is fine with that because its more fun when having fun to getter then making other farmers made because you buy the field they are trying to get already for a long time.

## Contractor rights

You can give other farmers contractor rights so they can use your equipment or help you with something. Before using equipment from a other farmer make sure the other farmer agrees with it sometimes they want a small fee for it but mostly it still cheaper then when you need to buy it or rent it.
The Global Cargo HR farm will allways give you contractor right as you need them to create exports (but your not allowed to use the equipment of the Global Cargo HR farm)

## Contracts & Exports

If your not able to compleet work on your farm the day it needs to be done you can ofcourse create a contract more info about this in how to create a contract. Exports can earn you a bit more money then selling your crops in game as Global Cargo HR mostly pays a good price for it more info about this in the create a export.
